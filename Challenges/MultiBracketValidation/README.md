# Multi-Bracket Validation

Given a string, validate whether or not each opening bracket has a matching closing bracket. If the string has a closing bracket for each opening bracket, and a closing bracket never comes before an opening bracket, return true. If not, return false.

Here, are some examples of valid strings that should output `true`:

> "{{{aEO}}}[]"

> "()a[]{e}((p\o))"


Here, are some invalid strings that should output `false`:

> "}}{{"

> "[(])"

> "{{}]"
