# Find Kth Element From Last

## Problem Domain

Given a singly linked list, write a method that accepts an integer `k` as a parameter. Locate the kth element from the last node of the list. If `k = 0` output the last node in the list. If `k  < 0` out put a message saying there aren't negative nodes, and output a message if `k` is greater than the total  number of nodes in the list.

## Big O

> Space complexity: O(1)
> Time complexity: O(n)
