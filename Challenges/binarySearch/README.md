# Binary Search

## Challenge Description

Write a method called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O time = O(log n).
Space complexity = O(1).
