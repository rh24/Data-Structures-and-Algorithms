# Fibonacci

Given an integer n, return the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. The rule of the Fibonacci sequence is that each number in the sequence is a sum of the two numbers that came before it.

> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

## Approach & Efficiency

Time complexity: O(n)
Space compexity: O(1)
