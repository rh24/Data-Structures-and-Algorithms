# Linked Lists

This is a basic implementation of the Linked List data structure. Linked List is a class that must be instantiated with a Node object. Node objects have two properties: Next and Value. Linked Lists have two properties: Current and Head. Both properties of the Linked List class are pointers that reference a Node in the LL. Current indicates where we are in the LL and Head indicates the start of the LL.

Node objects do not know about other Nodes except for their preceding Node and/or the Next node. Nodes must have a Value property of a specified type.
