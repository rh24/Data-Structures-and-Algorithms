# Graphs

Graphs are a data structure that depict a collection of points that may or may not be connected by edges of varying weight. Graphs consist of four components:

* Vertices - These may be thought of as nodes in the graph.
* Edges - The connection between two nodes. The weight of the connection may vary.
* Neighbor - Nodes next to a given vertex.
* Degree - The number of connections a vertex has.

This implementation will cover an undirected graph, meaning each edge is bi-directional.
