# Trees

Implement a Node class with Value, LeftChild, and RightChild properties. Additionally, add a Binary Tree class with three depth-first traversal methods: `PreOrder`, `InOrder`, and `PostOrder`. Last, add a Binary Search Tree clas that can `Add` a node to the tree and can `Search` for a value.
