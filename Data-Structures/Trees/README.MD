# Trees

## Implementation

Implement a Node class with Value, LeftChild, and RightChild properties. Additionally, add a Binary Tree class with three depth-first traversal methods: `PreOrder`, `InOrder`, and `PostOrder`. Last, add a Binary Search Tree clas that can `Add` a node to the tree and can `Search` for a value.

## Big O

> PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder

* Time complexity: O(n)
* Space complexity: O(n)

> Add

* Time complexity: O(log n)
* Space complexity: O(1)

> Search

* Time complexity: O(log n)
* Space complexity: O(1)
