# Stack and Queue

This is an implementation of the Stack and Queue data structures. Stacks are LIFO data structures: last one in, first one out. Queues, FIFO data structures, are the opposites: first one in, first one out.

## Stack
The methods that have been implemented in the Stack class are `Peek()`, `Push()`, and `Pop()`.

`Peek()` will look at the `Top` property of the stack.

`Pop()` will pop off the first node in the stack and return it.

`Push()` will add a node to the top of the stack.

## Queue

`Peek()` will preview the `Front` property of the queue.

`Enqueue(Node node)` will add a node to the end of the queue.

`Dequeue()` will remove a node from the Front of the queue and return it.
